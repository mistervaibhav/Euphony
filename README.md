Euphony, as the legends call it, the music player is capable of inducing you into a state of trance and make you closer to your ultimate destination, the good dear nirvana. The music is soothing and finally you get to break away yourself from the bullshit of online music players which are good for nothing and will always damn you to pay them for them to stop those annoying advertisements .aaaggghhh.

Ever wanted to shake the heck out of something but you never really got your hands on something worthy, well here is your chance. You shake your device and the song changes, let alone for once in your life to press little buttons on your ear pieces , or actually having to screen on your device and tap a tab, all this just to change one god damn song. But its easy peazy , isn't it.

And if this wasn't enough for you, Euphony has some of these very awesome , waves so you can say the last goodbye to sedatives because in the game of tranquility and calmness, Euphony is the Mister Steal the Show .

So here is the deal, take it or leave it. Euphony is your best bet and well there are other music players too but hey, they ain't Euphony.

Try Euphony out, your eargasm awaits .
Cheers.
